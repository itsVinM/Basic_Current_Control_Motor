# Basic Current Control Motor

This Simulink model demonstrates the concept of basic current control for a motor. The model consists of the following blocks:

- **Voltage Source:** The voltage source represents the electrical power source that supplies the motor.
- **Integrator:** This block integrates the motor current to obtain the motor torque.
- **Proportional Gain Block:** This block acts as the current controller, multiplying the current error by a proportional gain to produce a current control signal.
- **Saturation Block:** This block limits the current control signal to prevent excessive current flow in the motor.
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Block:** This block converts the current control signal into a PWM signal, which is the waveform applied to the motor's power stage.
- **Motor:** This block represents the motor, which converts the electrical energy into mechanical torque and rotation.
- **Rotor Current Measurement:** This block measures the actual rotor current of the motor.

## Operation

1. The voltage source provides electrical power to the motor.
2. The motor generates torque based on the current flowing through it.
3. The torque generated by the motor is integrated to estimate the rotor speed.
4. The desired current is set by the user.
5. The error between the desired current and the measured current is calculated.
6. The current error is multiplied by the proportional gain to produce the current control signal.
7. The current control signal is passed through a saturation block to prevent excessive current flow.
8. The saturated current control signal is converted into a PWM signal by the PWM block.
9. The PWM signal is applied to the motor's power stage to control the motor's current.

## Benefits of Current Control

Current control offers several benefits over open-loop voltage control, including:

- Improved Torque Control: More precise torque control for accurate speed and position control.
- Reduced Motor Heating: Minimizes overheating, extending motor lifespan and improving reliability.
- Improved Efficiency: Enhances the overall efficiency of the motor drive system.

## Applications

Current control is widely used in various applications, including:

- Electric Motors: Motor control in electric vehicles (vehicles data).

## Conclusion

Basic current control is a fundamental concept in motor control systems, ensuring precise torque regulation and efficient operation. By understanding the role of each block in the Simulink model, you can gain insights into the principles of current control and its application in various engineering fields.
